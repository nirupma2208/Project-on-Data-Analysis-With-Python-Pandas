# Case Study - 3 (adult-income-dataset) 

An individual’s annual income results from various factors. Intuitively, it is influenced by the individual’s education level, age, gender, occupation, and etc.

This is a widely cited KNN dataset. I encountered it during my course, and I wish to share it here because it is a good starter example for data pre-processing and Pandas practices.
